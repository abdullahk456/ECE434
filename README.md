# ECE434: Image Processing Project – Assignment 1

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of core image processing techniques developed for Assignment 1 of Drexel's **ECE434 - Digital Signal/Image Processing** course.

## 📌 Overview

The assignment showcases the following key image processing concepts:

### 🔧 Part 1: Gamma Correction
Applies gamma transformations to adjust image brightness:
- γ = 0.5 (brighter)
- γ = 1.0 (original)
- γ = 2.0 (darker)

> Implemented via `gamma_correction(img, gamma)` function.

### 🧠 Part 2: High-Boost Filtering
Sharpens an image by emphasizing edges using high-boost filtering:
- Enhances detail by adding a scaled Laplacian to the image.
- Demonstrated on the `moon.tiff` image.

> Function used: `highboost_filter_base(img, alpha)`

### 🧹 Part 3: Denoising and Edge Detection
1. **Denoising**:  
   - Averaging filter (`avg_filter_base`)
   - Median filter (`median3x3_base`)

2. **Edge Detection**:
   - Sobel operator applied to denoised images
   - Edge maps generated by magnitude thresholding

### 🧪 Local Functions Used
All implementations are written from scratch using **base MATLAB (no toolboxes)**:
- `gamma_correction`
- `highboost_filter_base`
- `avg_filter_base`
- `median3x3_base`

## 🖼️ Images Used
- `pout.tif`
- `moon.tiff`
- `peppersNoise1.tiff`

Ensure these images are located in the same directory as the script when running.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the Live Script or `.m` file in MATLAB.
2. Point MATLAB to the correct directory (as in the script `cd(...)`).
3. Run the script to display the results.
